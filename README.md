# SmoothDraw
Drawing curves using a variety of interpolation methods.  Currently, Bezier curves and Catmull-Rom splines are implemented.  There is also a method that draws a straight line between two points without curve interpolation.

The user is presented with a blank canvas.  He drags his cursor on the canvas, and a curve is interpolated and drawn on the canvas.
