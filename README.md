# SmoothDraw
Drawing curves using a variety of interpolation methods.  Currently, Bezier curves and Catmull-Rom splines are implemented.

The user is presented with a blank canvas.  He drags his cursor on the canvas, and a curve is interpolated using the last 20 points to draw a line on the canvas.

The user interface is found in the `main` method of `SmoothDrawCanvas`. Run this class to view the drawing widget.
